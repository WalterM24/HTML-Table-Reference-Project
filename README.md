# HTML-Table-Reference-Project
A simple table made with HTML and CSS Referencing HTML table tags, their name, and what they do.
Some challenges I faced was that I completely forgot how to make a table, which is pretty ironic.
This project took me about 2-3 hours but as the time went by I felt myself becoming more efficient.
